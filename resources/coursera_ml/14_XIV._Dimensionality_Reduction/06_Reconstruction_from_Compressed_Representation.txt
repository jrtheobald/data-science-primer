In some of the earlier videos,
I was talking about PCA as
a compression algorithm where you
may have say, a thousand dimensional
data and compress it
to a hundred dimensional feature back
there, or have three dimensional
data and compress it to a two dimensional representation.
So, if this is a
compression algorithm, there should
be a way to go back from
this compressed representation, back to
an approximation of your original high dimensional data.
So, given z(i), which maybe
a hundred dimensional, how do
you go back to your original
representation x(i), which was maybe a thousand dimensional?
In this video, I'd like to
describe how to do that.
In the PCA algorithm, we may have an example like this.
So maybe that's my example x1
and maybe that's my example x2.
And what we do
is, we take these examples and
we project them onto this one dimensional surface.
And then now we need
to use only a real number,
say z1, to specify the
location of these points after
they've been projected onto this one dimensional surface. So
, given a point
like this, given a point z1,
how can we go back to
this original two-dimensional space?
And in particular, given the
point z, which is an
r, can we map
this back to some approximate
representation x and r2
of whatever the original value of the data was?
So, whereas z equals 0
reduced transverse x, if you
want to go in the opposite
direction, the equation for
that is, we're going
to write x approx equals
U reduce times z.
Again, just to check the dimensions,
here U reduce is
going to be an n by k
dimensional vector, z is
going to be a k by 1 dimensional vector.
So, we multiply these out and that's going to be n by one.
So x approx is going
to be an n dimensional vector.
And so the intent of PCA,
that is, the square projection error
is not too big, is that
this x approx will be
close to whatever was
the original value of x
that you had used to derive z in the first place.
To show a picture of what this looks like, this is what it looks like.
What you get back of this
procedure are points that lie
on the projection of that onto the green line.
So to take our early example,
if we started off with
this value of x1, and got
this z1, if you plug
z1 through this formula to get
x1 approx, then this
point here, that will be
x1 approx, which is
going to be r2 and so.
And similarly, if you
do the same procedure, this will
be x2 approx.
And you know, that's a pretty
decent approximation to the original data.
So, that's how you
go back from your low dimensional
representation z back to
an uncompressed representation of
the data we get back an
the approxiamation to your original
data x, and we
also call this process reconstruction
of the original data.
When we think of trying to reconstruct
the original value of x from the compressed representation.
So, given an unlabeled data
set, you now know how to
apply PCA and take
your high dimensional features x and
map it to this
lower dimensional representation z, and
from this video, hopefully you now
also know how to take
these low representation z and
map the backup to an approximation
of your original high dimensional data.
Now that you know how to
implement in applying PCA, what
we will like to do next is to
talk about some of the
mechanics of how to
actually use PCA well,
and in particular, in the next
video, I like to talk
about how to choose K, which is,
how to choose the dimension
of this reduced representation vector z.
