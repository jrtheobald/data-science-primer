00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,010
For the problem of dimensionality

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,420
reduction, by far the

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,620
most popular, by far the

4
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,180
most commonly used algorithm is

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,460
something called principal components analysis or PCA.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,160
It In this video, I would

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,610
like to start talking about the

8
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,240
problem formulation for PCA,

9
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,090
in other words let us try

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,630
to formulate precisely exactly what

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,980
we would like PCA to do.

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,820
Let's say we have a dataset like

13
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,050
this, so this is a dataset

14
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,710
of example X in R2,

15
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,140
and let's say I want

16
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,640
to reduce the dimension of the

17
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,850
data from two dimensional to one dimensional.

18
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,130
In other words I would like to find

19
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,400
a line onto which to project the data.

20
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,680
So what seems like a good line onto which to project the data?

21
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,760
A line like this might be a pretty good choice.

22
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,790
And the reason you think

23
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,990
this might be a good choice is

24
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,420
that if you look at

25
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,230
where the projected versions of the points goes.

26
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,180
I'm gonna take this point and project it down here and get that.

27
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,500
This point gets projected here, to

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,220
here, to here, to here

29
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,360
what we find is that the

30
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,860
distance between each point

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,520
and the projected version is pretty small.

32
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,490
That is, these blue

33
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,210
line segments are pretty short.

34
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,260
So what PCA

35
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,730
does, formally, is it tries

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,320
to find a lower-dimensional surface

37
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,250
really a line in

38
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,660
this case, onto which to

39
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,260
project the data, so that

40
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,130
the sum of squares of these

41
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,570
little blue line segments is minimized.

42
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,780
The length of those blue line

43
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,530
segments, that's sometimes also called

44
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,710
the projection error, and so what PCA

45
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,480
does is it tries to find

46
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,840
the surface onto which to

47
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,350
project the data so as to

48
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,050
minimize that. As an a

49
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,460
side, before applying PCA

50
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,750
it's standard practice to

51
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,300
first perform mean normalization and

52
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,190
feature scaling so that the

53
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,760
features, X1 and X2,

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,770
should have zero mean and

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,740
should have comparable ranges of values.

56
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,320
I've already done this for this

57
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,590
example, but I'll come

58
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,990
back to this later and talk more

59
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,960
about feature scaling and mean normalization in the context of PCA later.

60
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,420
Coming back to this example,

61
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,470
in contrast to the red

62
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,300
lines that I just drew here's

63
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,970
a different line onto which I could project my data.

64
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,260
This magenta line.

65
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,260
And as you can see, you

66
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,660
know, this magenta line is a

67
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,920
much worse direction onto which to project my data, right?

68
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,020
So if I were to project my

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,430
data onto the magenta

70
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,050
line, like the other set of points like that.

71
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,240
And the projection errors, that

72
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,460
is these blue line segments would be huge.

73
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,930
So these points have to

74
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,170
move a huge distance in

75
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,840
order to get onto

76
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,760
the, in order to

77
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,440
get projected onto the magenta line.

78
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,390
And so that's why PCA

79
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,540
principle component analysis would choose

80
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,840
something like the red line

81
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,410
rather than like the magenta line down here.

82
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,280
Let's write out the PCA problem a little more formally.

83
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,660
The goal of PCA if we

84
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,150
want to reduce data from two-

85
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,580
dimensional to one-dimensional is

86
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,160
we're going to try to find

87
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,590
a vector, that is

88
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,160
a vector Ui

89
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,250
which is going to be in Rn,

90
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,170
so that would be in R2 in this case,

91
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,300
going to find direction onto

92
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,990
which to project the data so as to minimize the projection error.

93
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,710
So in this example I'm

94
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,180
hoping that PCA will find this

95
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,590
vector, which I'm going

96
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,960
to call U1, so that

97
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,340
when I project the data onto

98
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,620
the line that I defined

99
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,840
by extending out this vector,

100
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,650
I end up with pretty small

101
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,400
reconstruction errors and reference

102
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,220
data looks like this.

103
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,640
And by the way,

104
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,310
I should mention that whether PCA

105
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,150
gives me U1 or negative U1, it doesn't matter.

106
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,630
So if it gives me a positive

107
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,530
vector in this direction that's fine, if it gives me,

108
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,910
sort of the opposite vector facing

109
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,160
in the opposite direction, so that

110
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,150
would be -U1, draw that in

111
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,400
blue instead, whether it gives me positive

112
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,310
U1 negative U1,

113
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
it doesn't matter, because each of

114
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,030
these vectors defines the

115
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,660
same red line onto which

116
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,430
I'm projecting my data. So this

117
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,300
is a case of reducing data

118
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,120
from 2 dimensional to 1 dimensional.

119
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,220
In the more general case we

120
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,680
have N dimensional data and

121
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,790
we want to reduce it K dimensions.

122
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,010
In that case, we want to

123
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,450
find not just a single vector

124
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,020
onto which to project the data

125
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,660
but we want to find K dimensions

126
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,420
onto which to project the data.

127
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,680
So as to minimize this projection error.

128
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,100
So here's an example.

129
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,100
If I have a 3D point

130
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,030
cloud like this then maybe

131
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,620
what I want to do is find

132
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,120
vectors, sorry find a pair of vectors,

133
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,180
and I'm gonna call these vectors

134
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,530
lets draw these in red, I'm going

135
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,210
to find a pair of vectors,

136
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,580
extending for the origin here's

137
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,280
U1, and here's

138
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,800
my second vector U2,

139
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,110
and together these two

140
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,850
vectors define a plane,

141
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,590
or they define a 2D surface,

142
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,900
kind of like this, sort of,

143
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,140
2D surface, onto which I'm going to project my data.

144
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,900
For those of you that are

145
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,980
familiar with linear algebra, for

146
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,010
those of you that are really experts

147
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,380
in linear algebra, the formal

148
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,820
definition of this is that

149
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,500
we're going to find a set of

150
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,680
vectors, U1 U2 maybe up

151
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,370
to Uk, and what

152
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,490
we're going to do is project

153
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,600
the data onto the linear

154
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,520
subspace spanned by this set of k vectors.

155
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,570
But if you are not familiar

156
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,200
with linear algebra, just think

157
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,790
of it as finding k directions

158
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,380
instead of just one direction, onto which to project the data.

159
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,950
So, finding a k-dimensional surface,

160
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,560
really finding a 2D plane

161
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,870
in this case, shown in this

162
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,340
figure, where we can

163
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,700
define the position of the points in the plane using k directions.

164
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,690
That's why for PCA, we

165
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,440
want to find k vectors onto which to project the data.

166
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,920
And so, more formally, in

167
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,430
PCA what we want

168
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,400
to do is find this way

169
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,940
to project the data so as

170
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,570
to minimize the, sort of,

171
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,210
projection distance, which is distance between points and projections.

172
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,060
In this so 3D example,

173
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,100
too, given a point we

174
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,450
would take the point and project

175
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,950
it onto this 2D surface.

176
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,580
When you're done with that,

177
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,690
and so the projection error would

178
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,830
be, you know, the distance between the

179
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
point and where it gets projected down.

180
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,360
to my 2D surface,

181
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,990
and so what PCA does is it'll

182
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,480
try to find a line or

183
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,430
plane or whatever onto which

184
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,810
to project the data, to try

185
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,160
to minimize that squared projection,

186
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,430
that 90 degree, or that orthogonal projection error.

187
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,240
Finally, one question that I

188
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,060
sometimes get asked is how

189
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,100
does PCA relate to

190
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,180
linear regression, because when explaining

191
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,780
PCA I sometimes end up

192
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,720
drawing diagrams like these and that looks a little bit like linear regression.

193
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,130
It turns out PCA is not

194
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,950
linear regression, and despite

195
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,560
some cosmetic similarity these are actually totally different algorithms.

196
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
If we were doing linear regression

197
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,170
what we would do would be, on

198
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,940
the left we would be trying

199
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,400
to predict the value of some

200
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,830
variable y given some input

201
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,330
features x. And so linear

202
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,760
regression, what we're doing

203
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,350
is we're fitting a straight line

204
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,970
so as to minimize the squared

205
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,160
error between a point and the straight line.

206
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,270
And so what we'd be minimizing

207
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,320
would be the squared magnitude of these blue lines.

208
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,240
And notice I'm drawing these

209
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,650
blue lines vertically, that they

210
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,500
are the vertical distance between

211
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,700
a point and the value

212
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,470
predicted by the hypothesis, whereas in

213
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,100
contrast, in PCA, what it

214
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,170
does is it tries to

215
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,890
minimize the magnitude of these blue lines,

216
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,550
which are drawn at an angle,

217
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,590
these are really the shortest orthogonal

218
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,900
distances, the shortest distance between

219
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,620
the point X and this

220
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,320
red line, and this

221
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,870
gives very different effects, depending

222
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,050
on the data set.

223
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,610
And more generally generally and

224
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,890
more generally when you're doing

225
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,740
linear regression there is this

226
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,810
distinguished variable y that

227
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,130
we're trying to predict, all that

228
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,610
linear regression is about is taking all the values

229
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
of X and try to use

230
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,930
that to predict Y. Whereas

231
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,920
in PCA, there is no

232
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,200
distinguished or there is

233
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,900
no special variable Y that

234
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,770
we're trying to predict, and instead

235
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,100
we have a list of features

236
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,130
x1, x2, and so on

237
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,830
up to xN, and all of

238
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,460
these features are treated equally.

239
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,560
So, no one of them is special.

240
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,180
As one last example, if I

241
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,220
have three-dimensional data, and

242
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,660
I want to reduce data from

243
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,110
3D to 2D, so maybe

244
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,630
I want to find two directions,

245
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,110
you know, u1, and u2,

246
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,030
onto which to project my data,

247
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,840
then what I have is I

248
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,190
have three features, x1, x2,

249
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,410
x3, and all of these are treated alike.

250
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,100
All of these are treated symmetrically

251
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,240
and there is no special variable

252
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,740
y that I'm trying to predict.

253
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,320
And so PCA is not

254
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,210
linear regression, and even

255
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,870
though at some cosmetic level they

256
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,260
might look related, these are

257
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,580
actually very different algorithms. So,

258
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,360
hopefully you now understand what

259
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,960
PCA is doing: it's trying

260
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,520
to find a lower dimensional

261
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,290
surface onto which to project

262
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,230
the data so as to

263
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,420
minimize this squared projection error,

264
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,140
to minimize the squared distance between

265
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,660
each point and the location of where it gets projected.

266
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,040
In the next video we'll start

267
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,490
to talk about how to actually

268
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,350
find this lower dimensional surface

269
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,470
onto which to project the data.
