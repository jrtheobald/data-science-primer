1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,596
In this video we'll talk about

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,659
how to get logistic regression to

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,089
work for multi-class classification problems,

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,526
and in particular I want to

5
00:00:07,526 --> 00:00:12,070
tell you about an algorithm called one-versus-all classification.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,316
What's a multi-class classification problem?

7
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:15,945
Here are some examples.

8
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,318
Let's say you want a learning

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,691
algorithm to automatically put your

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,076
email into different folders or

11
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:23,398
to automatically tag your emails.

12
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,749
So, you might have different folders

13
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,052
or different tags for work email,

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,236
email from your friends, email

15
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:31,561
from your family and emails about your hobby.

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,145
And so, here, we have

17
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:34,856
a classification problem with 4

18
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,164
classes, which we might

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,129
assign the numbers, the classes

20
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,326
y1, y2, y3 and

21
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:43,530
y4 to, Another

22
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,790
example for a medical

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,260
diagnosis: if a patient

24
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,910
comes into your office with

25
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,395
maybe a stuffy nose, the possible

26
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:52,762
diagnoses could be that

27
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,140
they're not ill, maybe that's

28
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,474
y1; or they have

29
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,026
a cold, 2; or they have the flu.

30
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,541
And the third and final example,

31
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,056
if you are using machine learning

32
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,906
to classify the weather, you know,

33
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,299
maybe you want to decide that

34
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,937
the weather is sunny, cloudy, rainy

35
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,211
or snow, or if there's gonna be snow.

36
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,165
And so, in all of these

37
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:12,808
examples, Y can take

38
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:14,300
on a small number of

39
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,498
discreet values, maybe 1 to

40
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:17,810
3, 1 to 4 and so on, and

41
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,659
these are multi-class classification problems.

42
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,904
And by the way, it doesn't really

43
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:23,632
matter whether we index as

44
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:27,063
0123 or as 1234, I tend

45
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,138
to index that my classes

46
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:31,569
starting from 1 rather than starting from 0.

47
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,756
But either way, where often, it really doesn't matter.

48
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:35,243
Whereas previously, for a

49
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:39,375
binary classification problem, our data sets look like this.

50
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,617
For a multi-class classification problem, our

51
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:42,792
data sets may look like

52
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,362
this, where here, I'm using

53
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:48,399
three different symbols to represent our three classes.

54
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,858
So, the question is: Given the

55
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:51,613
data set with three classes

56
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,193
where this is a the

57
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:54,651
example of one class, that's

58
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:55,768
the example of the different class,

59
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,389
and, that's the example of yet, the third class.

60
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,421
How do we get a learning algorithm to work for the setting?

61
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,598
We already know how to

62
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:05,096
do binary classification, using logistic

63
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:06,594
regression, we know how the,

64
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,736
you know, maybe, for the straight line,

65
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:10,613
to separate the positive and negative classes.

66
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:12,116
Using an idea called one

67
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:14,399
versus all classification, we can

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,730
then take this, and, make

69
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,646
it work for multi-class classification, as well.

70
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,617
Here's how one versus all classification works.

71
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,777
And, this is also sometimes called "one versus rest."

72
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:26,941
Let's say, we have a training

73
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,138
set, like that shown on the

74
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,456
left, where we have 3 classes.

75
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,310
So, if y1, we denote that

76
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,405
with a triangle if y2 the

77
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,970
square and, if y3 then, the cross.

78
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,460
What we're going to do is,

79
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,350
take a training set, and, turn

80
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,816
this into three separate binary classification problems.

81
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,719
So, I'll turn this into three separate

82
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,450
two class classification problems.

83
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,660
So let's start with Class 1, which is a triangle.

84
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,990
We are going to essentially create a

85
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,418
new, sort of fake training set.

86
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,913
where classes 2 and 3

87
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,151
get assigned to the negative

88
00:02:58,151 --> 00:02:59,873
class and class 1

89
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:01,134
gets assigned to the positive class

90
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,352
when we create a new training

91
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,700
set if that's showing

92
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,508
on the right and we're going

93
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,573
to fit a classifier, which I'm

94
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:10,200
going to call h subscript theta

95
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,626
superscript 1 of x

96
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,659
where here, the triangles

97
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,008
are the positive examples and the circles are the negative examples.

98
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,649
So, think of the triangles be

99
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:21,800
assigned the value of 1

100
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,291
and the circles the sum, the value of zero.

101
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,723
And we're just going to train

102
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:29,556
a standard logistic regression crossfire

103
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:34,173
and maybe that will give us a position boundary.

104
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:34,173
OK?

105
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,693
The superscript 1 here is the class one.

106
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:40,777
So, we're doing this for the triangle first class.

107
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,302
Next, we do the same thing for class 2.

108
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:44,013
Going to take the squares and

109
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,456
assign the squares as the

110
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,001
positive class and assign

111
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:50,213
every thing else the triangles and the crosses as the negative class.

112
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,173
and then we fit a second logistic regression classifier.

113
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:56,410
I'm gonna call this H of X

114
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,352
superscript 2, where the

115
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,029
superscript 2 denotes that

116
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:01,860
we're now doing this:  treating the

117
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,310
square class as the positive

118
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,518
class and maybe we get the classifier like that.

119
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:08,854
And finally, we do the

120
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:10,143
same thing for the third

121
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:11,598
class and fit a third

122
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,632
classifier H superscript 3

123
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:16,424
of X and maybe this

124
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,106
will give us a decision boundary

125
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:19,749
or give us a classifier that separates

126
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,863
the positive and negative examples like that.

127
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,353
So, to summarize, what we've

128
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:27,872
done is we fit 3 classifiers.

129
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,403
So, for I equals 1

130
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,836
2 3 we'll fit a classifier

131
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,855
H superscript I subscript theta

132
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:35,193
of X, thus trying to

133
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,446
estimate what is the

134
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,208
probability that y is

135
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,834
equal to class I given X and prioritize by theta.

136
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:41,834
Right?

137
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,229
So, in the first

138
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,903
instance, for this first one

139
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,277
up here, this classifier

140
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,364
with learning to by the triangle.

141
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:52,037
So it's thinking of the triangles as a positive class.

142
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,840
So, X superscript one is

143
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,163
essentially trying to estimate what is

144
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,343
the probability that the Y

145
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,083
is equal to one, given

146
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,037
X and parametrized by theta.

147
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:04,475
And similarly, this is treating,

148
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,859
you know, the square class as

149
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,400
a positive took pause so its

150
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,748
trying to estimate the probability that y2 and so on.

151
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,300
So we now have 3 classifiers each

152
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,649
of which was trained is one of the three crosses.

153
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,859
Just to summarize, what we've

154
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,685
done is we've, we want

155
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,280
to train a logistic regression

156
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,560
classifier, H superscript I

157
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,947
of X, for each plus

158
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,183
i that predicts it's probably a

159
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:28,550
y i. Finally, to

160
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,740
make a prediction when we

161
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,772
give it a new input x and

162
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:33,326
we want to make a prediction,

163
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,729
we do is we just

164
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,706
run Let's say three

165
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:38,557
what run our 3 of our

166
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:40,010
classifiers on the input

167
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,535
x and we then

168
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:44,068
pick the class i that maximizes the three.

169
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:45,387
So, we just you know, basically

170
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,180
pick the classifier, pick whichever

171
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,163
one of the three classifiers is

172
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,178
most confident, or most enthusistically

173
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:54,352
says that it thinks it has a right class.

174
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:56,153
So, whichever value of i

175
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,069
gives us the highest probability, we

176
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,056
then predict y to be that value.

177
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,453
So, that's it for multi-class

178
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,677
classification and one-versus-all method.

179
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:09,120
And with this little method

180
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,521
you can now take the logistic

181
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:12,033
regression classifier and make

182
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:15,051
it work on multi-class classification problems as well.
