1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,704
In this video we'll talk about

2
00:00:01,704 --> 00:00:04,010
how to fit the parameters theta

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,869
for logistic regression.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,982
In particular, I'd like to

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,386
define the optimization objective or the

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,470
cost function that we'll use to fit the parameters.

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,370
Here's to supervised learning problem

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,892
of fitting a logistic regression model.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,210
We have a training set

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,964
of M training examples.

11
00:00:24,964 --> 00:00:26,577
And as usual each of

12
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:28,130
our examples is represented by

13
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,830
feature vector that's N plus 1 dimensional.

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,133
And as usual we have

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,498
X 0 equals 1.

16
00:00:36,498 --> 00:00:38,315
Our first feature, or our 0

17
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,951
feature is always equal to 1,

18
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,203
and because this is a

19
00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:43,335
classification problem, our training

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,999
set has the property that

21
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,422
every label Y, is either 0 or 1.

22
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:50,576
This is a hypothesis

23
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:52,007
and the parameters of the

24
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,460
hypothesis is this theta over here.

25
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,572
And the question I want

26
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,339
to talk about is given this

27
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,846
training set how do

28
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,482
we choose, or how do we fit the parameters theta?

29
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,125
Back when we were developing the

30
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:08,463
linear regression model, we use the following cost function.

31
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,868
I've written this slightly differently, where

32
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,663
instead of 1/2m, I've

33
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,440
taken the 1/2 and put it inside the summation instead.

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Now, I want to use

35
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,132
an alternative way of writing

36
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,663
out this cost function which is

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,009
that instead of writing out

38
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,920
this squared and return here,

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,100
let's write here, cost of

40
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,476
H of X comma

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,605
Y, and I'm going

42
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:37,176
to define that term cost

43
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,727
of H of X comma Y to be equal to this.

44
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,641
It's just equal to just one half of the square root error.

45
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,800
So now, we can see more

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,018
clearly that the cost

47
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,145
function is a sum

48
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:49,740
over my training set, or

49
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,427
is 1/m times the sum

50
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:56,046
over my training set of this cost term here.

51
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,065
And to simplify this

52
00:01:58,065 --> 00:01:59,470
equation a little bit more, it's gonna

53
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,587
be convenient to get rid of those superscripts.

54
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,408
So just define cost of

55
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:05,527
H of X comma Y to

56
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:06,618
be equal to 1/2 of

57
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:08,925
this square root error  and the

58
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:10,336
interpretation of this cost function

59
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,876
is that this is the

60
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,447
cost I want my learning

61
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,110
algorithm to, you know,

62
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,701
have to pay, if it

63
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,737
outputs that value it

64
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:19,912
this prediction is H of

65
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:21,258
X, and the actual

66
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,035
label was Y. So just

67
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,836
cross off those superscripts. All right.

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,756
And no surprise for linear

69
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:31,537
regression the cost for you to define is that.

70
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:32,757
Well the cost for this

71
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:34,535
is, that is 1/2

72
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,232
times the square difference

73
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:37,663
between what are predicted and the

74
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,943
actual value that we observe

75
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:41,103
for Y. Now, this cost

76
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:42,848
function worked fine for linear

77
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:47,418
regression, but here we're interested in logistic regression.

78
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,146
If we could minimize this cost

79
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,992
function that is plugged into J here.

80
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,817
That will work okay.

81
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:55,476
But it turns out that if

82
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,640
we use this particular cost function

83
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,807
this would be a non-convex function of the parameters theta.

84
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,968
Here's what I mean by non-convex.

85
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,313
We have some cost function J

86
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:08,118
of theta, and for logistic

87
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,113
regression this function H here

88
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:13,495
has a non linearity, right?

89
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,538
It says, you know, 1 over

90
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:16,384
1 plus E to the negative theta transfers

91
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:19,591
X. So it's a pretty complicated nonlinear function.

92
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,108
And if you take the sigmoid

93
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,104
function and plug it in

94
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:23,239
here and then take

95
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,016
this cost function and plug

96
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,746
it in there, and then plot

97
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:28,200
what J of theta looks

98
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,650
like, you find that

99
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,493
J of theta can look like a function just like this.

100
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,958
You know with many local optima and

101
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,321
the formal term for this

102
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,488
is that this a non convex function.

103
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,644
And you can kind of tell.

104
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:41,880
If you were to run gradient

105
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,192
descent on this sort of

106
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,160
function, it is not guaranteed

107
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,747
to converge to the global minimum.

108
00:03:47,747 --> 00:03:48,867
Whereas in contrast, what

109
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,350
we would like is to have

110
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,100
a cost function J of theta

111
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,599
that is convex, that is

112
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,250
a single bow-shaped function that

113
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,675
looks like this, so that

114
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,543
if you run gradient descent, we

115
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:01,147
would be guaranteed that gradient descent, you know,

116
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,917
would converge to the global minimum.

117
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,020
And the problem of using the

118
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,460
the square cost function is that

119
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,400
because of this very

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,371
non linear sigmoid function that

121
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,107
appears in the middle here, J of

122
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:15,987
theta ends up being

123
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:17,962
a non convex function if you

124
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:21,294
were to define it as the square cost function.

125
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,313
So what we'd would like to do

126
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,822
is to instead come up with

127
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:25,576
a different cost function that

128
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:28,063
is convex and so

129
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:29,257
that we can apply a great

130
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,919
algorithm like gradient descent

131
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,683
and be guaranteed to find a global minimum.

132
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:37,295
Here's a cost function that we're going to use for logistic regression.

133
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,313
We're going to say the cost

134
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,710
or the penalty that the algorithm

135
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,924
pays if it outputs

136
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:44,596
a value H of X.

137
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,722
So, this is some number like 0.7

138
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:48,670
where it predicts a value H

139
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,780
of X. And the actual

140
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,032
cost label turns out to

141
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:54,087
be Y. The cost is

142
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,061
going to be minus log

143
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,861
H of X if Y is equal 1.

144
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,447
And minus log, 1 minus

145
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,010
H of X if Y is equal to 0.

146
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,205
This looks like a pretty complicated function.

147
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,773
But let's plot function to

148
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,147
gain some intuition about what it's doing.

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,054
Let's start up with the case of Y equals 1.

150
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,461
If Y is equal equal

151
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:14,958
to 1, then the cost function

152
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:18,240
is -log H of X, and

153
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,601
if we plot that, so let's

154
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:21,564
say that the horizontal

155
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,961
axis is H of X.

156
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,722
So we know that a hypothesis

157
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,611
is going to output a value between

158
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,465
0 and 1.

159
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:28,465
Right?

160
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,514
So H of X that varies

161
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,940
between 0 and 1.

162
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,469
If you plot what this cost function looks like.

163
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,981
You find that it looks like this.

164
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,044
One way to see why the

165
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:41,363
plot like this it is because

166
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,988
if you were to plot log Z

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,656
with Z on the horizontal axis.

168
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:48,794
Then that looks like that.

169
00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:50,369
And it's approach is minus infinity.

170
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:53,700
So this is what the log function looks like.

171
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,963
And so this is 0, this is 1.

172
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,560
Here Z is of

173
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,653
course playing the role  of

174
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:02,030
H of X.  And so

175
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,329
minus log Z will look like this.

176
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,098
Right just flipping the sign.

177
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,822
Minus log Z. And we're

178
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:11,013
interested only in the

179
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,580
range of when this function

180
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,014
goes between 0 and 1.

181
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:15,924
So, get rid of that.

182
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:17,962
And so, we're just left with,

183
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,555
you know, this part of the curve.

184
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,200
And that's what this curve on the left looks like.

185
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,472
Now this cost function

186
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,666
has a few interesting and desirable properties.

187
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,103
First you notice that if

188
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:35,003
Y is equal to 1 and H of X is equal 1, in

189
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,367
other words, if the hypothesis

190
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,000
exactly, you know, predicts

191
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,261
H equals 1, and Y

192
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:42,744
is exactly equal to what I predicted.

193
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:44,432
Then the cost is equal 0.

194
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:44,432
Right?

195
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:47,475
That corresponds to, the curve doesn't actually flatten out.

196
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:49,866
The curve is still going. First, notice

197
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,006
that if H of X

198
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:53,056
equals 1, if the hypothesis

199
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:55,113
predicts that Y is equal to 1.

200
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:56,342
And if indeed Y is

201
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:58,502
equal to 1 then the cost is equal to 0.

202
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,975
That corresponds to this point down here.

203
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:00,975
Right?

204
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,332
If H of X is equal

205
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:04,068
to 1, and we're only

206
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,273
concerned the case that Y equals 1 here.

207
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:08,366
But if H of X is equal to 1.

208
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,063
Then the cost is down here is equal to 0.

209
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,082
And that is what we like it to be.

210
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:13,968
Because, you know, if we

211
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:17,673
correctly predict the output Y then the cost is 0.

212
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:21,466
But now, notice also

213
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,456
that H of X approaches 0.

214
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,037
So, that's H. As the

215
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,909
output of the hypothesis approaches 0

216
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:30,163
the cost blows up, and it goes to infinity.

217
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,513
And what this does is

218
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:34,271
it captures the intuition that if

219
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,890
a hypothesis, you know, outputs 0.

220
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,574
That's like saying, our hypothesis is

221
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:39,960
saying, the chance of Y

222
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,541
equals 1 is equal to 0.

223
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,516
It's kind of like our going

224
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,010
to our medical patient and saying,

225
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,594
"The probability that you

226
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,337
have a malignant tumor, the

227
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:49,807
probability that Y equals 1 is zero."

228
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:52,154
So, it's like absolutely impossible that your

229
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,130
tumor is malignant.

230
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,776
But if it turns out that

231
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:00,111
the tumor, the patient's tumor, actually is malignant.

232
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:01,879
So if Y is equal to

233
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,291
1 even after we told them

234
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,375
you know, the probability of it happening is 0.

235
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,716
It's absolutely impossible for it to be malignant.

236
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:09,759
But if we told them

237
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,186
this with that level of certainty,

238
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,018
and we turn out to be wrong,

239
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:14,688
then we penalize the learning algorithm

240
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,122
by a very, very large cost,

241
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:17,963
and that's captured by having this

242
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,474
cost goes infinity if Y

243
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:21,900
equals 1 and H

244
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,334
of X approaches 0.

245
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,725
This might consider of

246
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,875
Y1, let's look at what

247
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,371
the cost function looks like for Y0.

248
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,710
If Y is equal to 0, then the cost

249
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,121
looks like this expression over here.

250
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,403
And if you plot

251
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,751
the function minus log 1

252
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,839
minus Z what you

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,245
get is the cost function actually looks like this.

254
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,256
So, it goes from 0 to 1.

255
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,263
Something like that.

256
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,611
And so if you plot

257
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:55,872
the cost function for the case

258
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:57,823
of y equals zero, you find that it looks

259
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:00,763
like this and what

260
00:09:00,763 --> 00:09:02,404
this curve does is it

261
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:04,937
now blows up,

262
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:08,273
and it goes to plus infinity as H of X goes to 1.

263
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,880
Because it's saying that

264
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,199
if Y turns out to be

265
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,168
equal to 0, but we

266
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,966
predicted that you know, Y is

267
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:15,286
equal to 1 with almost

268
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,281
certainty with probability 1, then

269
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:21,569
we end up paying a very large cost.

270
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:23,143
Let's plot the cost function for

271
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:25,063
the case of Y equals 0.

272
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:29,702
So if Y equals 0 that's going to be our cost function.

273
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,914
If you look at this expression,

274
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:33,726
and if you plot, you know, minus

275
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:36,221
log 1 minus Z, if

276
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:37,428
you figure out what that looks like,

277
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:40,071
you get a figure that looks like this.

278
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:41,669
Where, which goes from 0

279
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,610
to 1 with the Z

280
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,850
axis on the horizontal axis.

281
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,221
So If you take this cost

282
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:48,397
function and plot it for

283
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:49,614
the case of Y equals 0,

284
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:51,186
what you get is

285
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:55,109
that the cost function looks like this.

286
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:56,743
And what this cost function

287
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:58,650
does is that it blows

288
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,530
up or it goes to a

289
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,448
positive infinity as each

290
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:03,707
H of X goes to one

291
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,443
and this captures the

292
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:07,159
intuition that if a hypothesis

293
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,847
predicted that, you know, H of

294
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,406
X is equal to 1 with

295
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:12,121
certainty, with like probability 1,

296
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:14,283
it's absolutely got to be Y equals 1.

297
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:15,563
But if Y turned out to

298
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,219
be equal to 0 then

299
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:18,206
it makes sense to make the

300
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:21,940
hypothesis, or make the learning algorithm pay a very large cost.

301
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,609
And conversely, if H

302
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,942
of X is equal to

303
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,483
0 and Y equals zero,

304
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:28,983
then the hypothesis nailed it.

305
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,626
The predicted Y is equal

306
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,371
to zero and it turns

307
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:34,376
out Y is equal to zero

308
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:36,701
so at this point the cost

309
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,139
function is going to be 0.

310
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,163
In this video, we

311
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:43,886
have defined the cost function

312
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:46,428
for a single training example.

313
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:50,251
The topic of convexity analysis is beyond the scope of this course.

314
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,594
But it is possible to show

315
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,080
that with our particular choice

316
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,774
of cost function this would

317
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:57,926
give us a convex optimization problem

318
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,081
as cost function, overall cost function

319
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:01,463
J of theta will be

320
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:04,368
convex and local optima free.

321
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,691
In the next video we're going

322
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:07,753
to take these ideas of the

323
00:11:07,753 --> 00:11:08,923
cost function for a single

324
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:10,839
training example and develop that

325
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,522
further and define the

326
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:13,773
cost function for the entire

327
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,104
training set, and we'll also

328
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:17,404
figure out a simpler way to

329
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:19,699
write it than we have been using so far.

330
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:21,016
And based on that will

331
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,779
work out gradient descent, and

332
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,835
that will give us our logistic regression algorithm.
