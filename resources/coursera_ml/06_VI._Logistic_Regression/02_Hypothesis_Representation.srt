1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,931
Let's start talking about logistic regression.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,315
In this video, I'd like to

3
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:07,210
show you the hypothesis representation, that

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,805
is, what is the function

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,266
we're going to use to represent

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,446
our hypothesis where we have a classification problem.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,969
Earlier, we said that we

8
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:20,426
would like our classifier to

9
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:21,956
output values that are between

10
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,250
zero and one. So, we

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,566
like to come up with a

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,385
hypothesis that satisfies this

13
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:30,396
property, that these predictions are maybe between zero and one.

14
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:32,764
When we were using linear regression,

15
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:34,262
this was the form of a

16
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:35,604
hypothesis, where H of X

17
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:38,319
is theta transpose X.  For

18
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,831
logistic regression, I'm going

19
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,075
to modify this a little

20
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,352
bit, and make the hypothesis

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,218
G of theta transpose X,

22
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:47,711
where I'm going to define

23
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:50,693
the function G as follows:

24
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:51,926
G of Z if Z

25
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,633
is a real number is equal

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,640
to one over one plus

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,480
E to the negative Z. This

28
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,716
called the sigmoid function

29
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,843
or the logistic function.

30
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:07,089
And the term logistic function,

31
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,103
that's what give rise to the name logistic progression.

32
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:12,781
And, by the way, the terms

33
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,551
sigmoid function and logistic

34
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,996
function are basically synonyms

35
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:18,362
and mean the same thing.

36
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:19,756
So the two terms are

37
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:21,893
basically interchangeable and either

38
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:23,160
term can be used to

39
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,620
refer to this function

40
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,283
G.
And if we

41
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:27,734
take these two equations, and

42
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:30,089
put them together, then here's

43
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,354
just an alternative way of

44
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:34,843
writing out the form of my hypothesis.

45
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:36,533
I'm saying that H of x

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,933
is one over one plus

47
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,765
E to the negative theta transpose

48
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:43,106
X, and all I've done is

49
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:45,353
I've taken the variable

50
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:46,700
Z, Z here's a

51
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,173
real number and plugged in

52
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:50,201
theta transpose X, so

53
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,560
I end up with, you know, theta transpose

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,933
X, in place of Z there.

55
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,949
Lastly, let me show you where the sigmoid function looks like.

56
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:00,296
We're going to plot it on this figure here.

57
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,022
The sigmoid function, G of

58
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,652
Z, also called the logistic function, looks like this.

59
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:07,078
It starts off near zero and

60
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,366
then rises until it processes

61
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:13,473
0.5 at the origin and then it flattens out again like so.

62
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,051
So that's what the sigmoid function looks like.

63
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,898
And you notice that the

64
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:19,725
sigmoid function, well, it

65
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,894
asymptotes at one, and

66
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:24,256
asymptotes at zero as

67
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:26,388
Z against the horizontal axis

68
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:27,659
is Z. As Z goes to

69
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,304
minus infinity, G of

70
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:31,396
Z approaches zero and as

71
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:33,816
G of Z approaches infinity, G

72
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:35,864
of Z approaches 1, and

73
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,252
so because G of

74
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:39,408
Z offers values that are

75
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,696
between 0 and 1 we

76
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,592
also have that H of

77
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,141
X must be between 0 and 1.

78
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:50,029
Finally, given this hypothesis

79
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,123
representation, what we

80
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:53,740
need to do, as before,

81
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,841
is fit the parameters theta to our data.

82
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,490
So given a training set, we

83
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,743
need to pick a value for

84
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:03,773
the parameters theta and this

85
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:06,981
hypothesis will then let us make predictions.

86
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:08,534
We'll talk about a learning algorithm

87
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:11,828
later for fitting the parameters theta.

88
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:13,506
But first let's talk a

89
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:17,379
bit about the interpretation of this model.

90
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,612
Here's how I'm going to

91
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,660
interpret the output of

92
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,637
my hypothesis H of

93
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,387
X.  When my hypothesis

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,238
outputs some number, I am

95
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,126
going to treat that number as

96
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,400
the estimated probability that Y

97
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,170
is equal to one on a

98
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,266
new input example X. Here is what I mean.

99
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,324
Here is an example.

100
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:43,932
Let's say we're using the tumor classification example.

101
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,234
So we may have a feature

102
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,945
vector X, which is this x01

103
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:49,860
as always and then our

104
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,836
one feature is the size of the tumor.

105
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:54,045
Suppose I have a patient come

106
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:55,459
in and, you know they have some

107
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:57,183
tumor size and I

108
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,759
feed their feature vector X

109
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,963
into my hypothesis and suppose

110
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,760
my hypothesis outputs the number 0.7.

111
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,758
I'm going to interpret

112
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,298
my hypothesis as follows.

113
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:08,790
I'm going to say that this

114
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,235
hypothesis is telling me

115
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:12,143
that for a patient with

116
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:14,490
features X, the probability

117
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,772
that Y equals one is 0  .7.

118
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:18,703
In other words, I'm going

119
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,106
to tell my patient that the

120
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,320
tumor, sadly, has

121
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,836
a 70% chance or a 0.7 chance of being malignant.

122
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,420
To write this out slightly more

123
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,473
formally or to write this

124
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,763
out in math, I'm going to

125
00:04:31,763 --> 00:04:34,803
interpret my hypothesis output

126
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,144
as P of y

127
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,913
equals 1, given X

128
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,813
parametrized by theta.

129
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,389
So, for those of you that are

130
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,320
familiar with probability, this equation

131
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,766
might make sense, if you're a little less familiar

132
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,673
with probability, you know, here's

133
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:51,564
how I read this expression, this

134
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,215
is the probability that y is

135
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,988
equals to one, given x

136
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:56,493
instead of given that my patient

137
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:58,027
has, you know, features X.

138
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,860
Given my patient has a particular

139
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,575
tumor size represented by my

140
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,156
features X, and this

141
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:06,956
probability is parametrized by theta.

142
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,166
So I'm basically going to count

143
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,009
on my hypothesis to give

144
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,332
me estimates of the probability

145
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:15,349
that Y is equal to 1.

146
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,523
Now since this is a

147
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:18,629
classification task, we know

148
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,497
that Y must be either zero or one, right?

149
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:23,373
Those are the only two values

150
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,466
that Y could possibly take on,

151
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:26,654
either in the training set or

152
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:28,077
for new patients that may walk

153
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:32,014
into my office or into the doctor's office in the future.

154
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:33,529
So given H of X,

155
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,153
we can therefore compute the probability

156
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:39,116
that Y is equal to zero as well.

157
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:41,209
Concretely, because Y must

158
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,065
be either zero or one,

159
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,141
we know that the probability

160
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:46,329
of Y equals zero, plus the

161
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,512
probability of Y equals

162
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,173
one, must add up to one.

163
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:51,483
This first equation looks a

164
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:52,828
little bit more complicated but it's

165
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:54,603
basically saying that probability of

166
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,287
Y equals zero for a

167
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,319
particular patient with features x, and

168
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,002
you know, given our parameter's theta, plus the

169
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,305
probability of Y equals one for

170
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:04,470
that same patient which features x and you

171
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:06,334
parameters theta must add

172
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,260
up to one, if this equation

173
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,171
looks a little bit complicated feel free

174
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,049
to mentally imagine it without that X and theta.

175
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:15,476
And this is just saying that

176
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,993
the probability of Y equals zero plus

177
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:19,272
the probability of Y equals one must be equal to one.

178
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,365
And we know this to be

179
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:23,120
true because Y has to be either zero or one.

180
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,240
And so the chance of Y

181
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,918
being zero plus the chance

182
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,547
that Y is one, you know, those two must add up to one.

183
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:31,387
And so if you just

184
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,780
take this term and move

185
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,409
it to the right-hand side, then

186
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,327
you end up with this equation

187
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:38,995
that says probability Y equals zero

188
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:40,502
is one minus probability y equals

189
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,548
and thus if our

190
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,009
hypothesis if H of X

191
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,775
gives us that term you can

192
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,948
therefore quite simply compute the

193
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:51,508
probability, or compute the

194
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,282
estimated probability that Y

195
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:55,411
is equal to zero as well.

196
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:56,720
So you now know what

197
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,779
the hypothesis representation is for

198
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,576
logistic regression and we're seeing

199
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,534
what the mathematical formula is

200
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:06,701
defining the hypothesis for logistic regression.

201
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:07,880
In the next video, I'd like

202
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,018
to try to give you

203
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,091
better intuition about what the

204
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,518
hypothesis function looks like.

205
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:13,606
And I want to tell

206
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,294
you something called the decision

207
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:16,700
boundary and we'll look

208
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,846
at some visualizations together to

209
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,186
try to get a better sense

210
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:22,370
of what this hypothesis function of

211
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,697
logistic regression really looks like.
