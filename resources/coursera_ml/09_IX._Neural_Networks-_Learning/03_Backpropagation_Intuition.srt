1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,120
In the previous video, we talked about the back propagation algorithm.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,090
To a lot of people

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,140
seeing it for the first time,

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,610
the first impression is often

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,250
that wow, this is

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,650
a very complicated algorithm and there are all

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,990
these different steps. And I'm

8
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,980
not quite sure how they fit

9
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,130
together and its like kind

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,830
of a black box with all these complicated steps.

11
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:18,830
In case that 's how you are

12
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,460
feeling about back propagation, that's

13
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,100
actually okay.

14
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,100
Back propagation may be unfortunately

15
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,920
is a less mathematically clean or

16
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,520
less mathematically simple algorithm

17
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,680
compared to linear regression or

18
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,850
logistic regression, and I've

19
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,560
actually used back propagation, you know, pretty

20
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,310
successfully for many years and

21
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,130
even today, I still don't sometimes

22
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,320
feel like I have a very

23
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,790
good sense of just what

24
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,580
it's doing most of intuition about

25
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,980
what background propagation is doing.

26
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,850
For those of you that are doing

27
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,920
the programming exercises that will

28
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,970
at least mechanically step you

29
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,710
through the different steps of

30
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,910
how to implement back prop

31
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,860
so you will be able to get it to work for yourself.

32
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,850
And what I want to do

33
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,170
in this video is look a

34
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,750
little bit more at the

35
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,640
mechanical steps of back propagation

36
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,620
and try to give you a little

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,450
more intuition about what the

38
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,080
mechanical steps of back prop

39
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,590
is doing to hopefully convince you

40
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,530
that, you know, it is at least a reasonable algorithm.

41
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,240
In case even after this video, in

42
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,000
case back propagation still seems

43
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,920
very black box and kind

44
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,600
of like, you know, too many complicated

45
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,230
steps, a little bit magical to to

46
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,740
you, that's actually okay.

47
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,760
And even though,

48
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,840
you know, I have used back prop

49
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,590
for many years, sometimes it's a difficult algorithm to understand.

50
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,140
But hopefully this video will help a little bit.

51
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,970
In order to better understand back

52
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,660
propagation, let's take another

53
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,290
closer look at what forward propagation is doing.

54
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,420
Here's the neural network with two

55
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,070
input units that is not

56
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,480
counting the bias unit, and

57
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,300
two hidden units in this

58
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,590
layer and two hidden units

59
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,490
in the next layer, and then

60
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,090
finally one output unit.

61
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,800
And again, these counts 2,

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,240
2, 2 are not counting these bias units on top.

63
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,170
In order to illustrate forward

64
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,570
propagation, I'm going to

65
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,080
draw this network a little bit differently.

66
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,180
And in particular, I'm going to

67
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,840
draw this neural network with the

68
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,620
nodes drawn as these very

69
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,010
fat ellipses, so that I can write text in them.

70
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,800
When performing forward propagation,

71
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,900
we might have some particular example,

72
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,190
say some example x(i) comma

73
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,990
y(i) and it will

74
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,550
be this x(i) that we

75
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,460
feed into the input layer, so

76
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,850
that this may be,

77
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,290
x(i)1 and x(i)2 are the

78
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,360
values we set the input

79
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,870
layer to and when we

80
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,350
forward propagate it to the

81
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,210
first hidden layer here, what

82
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,070
we do is compute z(2)1 and

83
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,900
z(2)2, so these are the

84
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,010
weighted sum of inputs of the

85
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,000
input units and then

86
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,680
we apply the sigmoid of

87
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,670
the logistic function and the

88
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,630
sigmoid activation function applied

89
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,670
to the z value, gives us

90
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,520
these activation values.

91
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,670
So that gives us a(2)1

92
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,160
and a(2)2, and then we

93
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,500
forward propagate again to get,

94
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,570
you know, here z(3)1,

95
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,500
apply the sigmoid of the

96
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,500
logistic function, the activation function

97
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,200
to that, to get the

98
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,310
31 and similarly Like so,

99
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,850
until we get z(4)1, apply the

100
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,450
activation function this gives

101
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,940
us a(4)1 which is the

102
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,030
finer output value of the network.

103
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,920
Let's erase this arrow to

104
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,490
give myself some space, and if

105
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,170
you look at what this

106
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,280
computation really is doing, focusing

107
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,970
on this hidden unit

108
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,860
lets say we have that

109
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,770
this weight, shown in

110
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,500
magenta there, is my

111
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,820
weight theta 2(1)0 the

112
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,930
indexing is not important, and this

113
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,440
way here which I guess

114
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,270
I am highlighting in red, that

115
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,290
is theta 2(1)1 and

116
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,970
this weight here, which I'm

117
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,370
drawing in green, in a cyan,

118
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,530
is theta 2(1)2 so

119
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,970
the way the computers value z(3)1

120
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,230
is z(3)1 is as

121
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,120
equal to this Weight,

122
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,840
times this value so that's

123
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,970
theta 2(1)0 times 1,

124
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,190
plus this red

125
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,480
weight times this value, so

126
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,690
that's theta 2(1)1 times

127
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,520
a(2)1, and finally this

128
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,140
cyan red times this value,

129
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,950
which is therefore, plus theta

130
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,300
2(1)2 times a(2)1.

131
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,170
And so that's forward propagation.

132
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,680
And it turns out that, as

133
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,730
we see later on in this

134
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,140
video, what back propagation

135
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,730
is doing, is doing a

136
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,120
process very similar to

137
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,860
this, except that instead of

138
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,120
the computations flowing from the

139
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,270
left to the right of this network,

140
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,510
the computations is there flow

141
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,070
from the right to the

142
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,720
left of the network, and using

143
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,170
a very similar computation as this,

144
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,710
and I'll say in two

145
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,260
slides exactly what I mean by that.

146
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,880
To better understand what back

147
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,710
propagation is doing, let's look

148
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,920
at the cost function, it's just the

149
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,270
cost function that we had for

150
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,950
when we have only one output unit.

151
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,300
If we have more than

152
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,410
one output unit, we just

153
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,850
have a summation, you know, over the

154
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,170
output units index, if only

155
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,990
one output unit then this

156
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,490
is a cost function operation and

157
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,340
we do forward propagation and back propagation on one example at a time.

158
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,440
So, let's just focus on the

159
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,770
single example x(i)y(i), and focus

160
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,480
on the case of having one output

161
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,390
unit so y(i) here

162
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,390
is just a real number, and

163
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,790
let's ignore regularization, so lambda

164
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,300
equals zero, and this final

165
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,480
term, that regularization term goes away.

166
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,220
Now, if you look inside

167
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,480
this summation, you find that

168
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,290
the cost term associated with

169
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,980
the I'f training example, that

170
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,230
is, the cost associated with training

171
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,420
example x(i)y(i), that's

172
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,820
going to be given by this expression, that the

173
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,270
cost, sort of, of training example

174
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,910
i is written as follows.

175
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,320
And what this cost

176
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,650
function does, is it plays

177
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,580
a role similar to the square error.

178
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,530
So, rather than looking at this

179
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,050
complicated expression, if you

180
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,380
want you can think of cos

181
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,600
of i being approximately, you know, the square of

182
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,310
difference between or the

183
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,870
neural network outputs versus what

184
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,980
is the actual value. Just as

185
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,340
in logistic regression, we actually

186
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,510
prefer to use this slightly

187
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,060
more complicated cost function using

188
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,580
the log, but for the

189
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,230
purpose of intuition, feel free

190
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,440
to think of the cost function

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,750
as being sort of the squared

192
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,000
error cost function, and so

193
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,870
this cos of i measures how

194
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,780
well is the network doing on

195
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,600
correctly predicting example i.

196
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,000
How close is the output

197
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,640
to the actually observed label y(i).

198
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,610
Now let's look at what back propagation is doing.

199
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,170
One useful intuition is that

200
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,940
back propagation is computing these

201
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,840
delta superscript l

202
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,440
subscript j terms, and we

203
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,520
can think of these as

204
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,070
the quote error of the

205
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,460
activation value that we

206
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,980
got for unit j in

207
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,750
the layer, in the

208
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,400
lth layer.

209
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,070
More formally, and this is

210
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,280
maybe only for those of

211
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,480
you that are familiar with calculus,

212
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,080
more formally, what the delta

213
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,820
terms actually are is this:

214
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,810
they're the partial derivative with respect

215
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,000
to z(l)j, that is

216
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,460
the weighted sum of inputs that

217
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,700
we're computing the z terms,

218
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,760
partial derivative respect of these things of the cost function.

219
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,650
So concretely the cost function

220
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,000
is a function of the label

221
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,350
y and of the

222
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,680
value, this h of

223
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,060
x output value neural network. And

224
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,430
if we could go inside the neural network

225
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,200
and just change those z(l)j

226
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,450
values a little bit, then

227
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,250
that would affect these values that the neural net.

228
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,290
And so that will end up changing the cost function.

229
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,120
And again really this

230
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,690
is only for those of you expert in calculus.

231
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,580
If you are familiar with comfortable with partial derivatives.

232
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,860
What these delta terms are,

233
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,270
is they're, they turn out to

234
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,800
be the partial derivative of the

235
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,010
cos function with respect to these intermediate terms that we're computing.

236
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,250
And so their measure of

237
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,940
how much would we like to

238
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,090
change the neural network's weights in

239
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,620
order to affect these intermediate values

240
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,110
of the computation, so as

241
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,430
to affect the final output the

242
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,980
neural network h of x and

243
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,770
therefore affect the overall cost.

244
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,820
In case this last part of

245
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,290
this partial derivative intuition, in case

246
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,920
that didn't make sense, don't worry

247
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,230
about it, the rest of this

248
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,770
we can do without really

249
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,400
talking partial derivatives but let's

250
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,780
look in more detail at what

251
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,020
back propagation is doing.

252
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,440
For the output layer, if first

253
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,630
sets this delta term, we say

254
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,400
delta 4(1), as y(i)

255
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,430
if we're doing forward propagation

256
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,010
and back propagation on this

257
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,180
training example i. It says it's y(i)

258
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,970
minus a(4)1,

259
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,370
so it's really the error, it's

260
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,680
the difference between the actual value

261
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,210
of y minus what was

262
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,020
the value predicted.

263
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,160
And so we're going to compute delta

264
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,880
4(1) like so.

265
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,200
Next we're going to do propagate these values backwards.

266
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,820
I explain this in a second

267
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,810
and end up computing the delta terms of the previous layer.

268
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,450
We're going to end up

269
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,720
with delta 3(1); delta 3(2);

270
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,210
and then we're going to

271
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,940
propagate this further

272
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,340
backward and end up

273
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,960
computing delta 2(1) and

274
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,800
delta 2(2).

275
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,290
Now the back propagation calculation

276
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,050
is a lot like running the

277
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,870
forward propagation algorithm, but doing it backwards.

278
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,890
So here's what I mean.

279
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,300
Let's look at how we end

280
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,370
up with this value of Delta 2(2).

281
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,280
So we have Delta

282
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,330
2(2) and similar to

283
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,760
forward propagation, let me label a couple of the weights.

284
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,620
So this weight should be one cyan--let's say

285
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,680
that weight is theta 2

286
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,190
of 1, 2 and this

287
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,970
weight down here, let me highlight

288
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,740
this in red. That's going to be, let's say,

289
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,760
theta 2 of 2, 2.

290
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,410
So if we

291
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,450
look at how Delta 2(2)

292
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,540
is computed. How it's computed for this note. It turns

293
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,690
out that what we're

294
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,830
going to do is

295
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,030
we're going to take this value and

296
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,340
multiply it by this weight and

297
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,770
add it to this value

298
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,660
multiplied by that weight.

299
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,850
So it's really a weighted sum

300
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,880
of the new, these delta values.

301
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,570
weighted by the corresponding edge strength.

302
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,270
So concretely, let me fill this in.

303
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,550
This delta 2,2 is going to

304
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,610
be equal to theta 2(1)2,

305
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,660
which is that magenta weight,

306
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,850
times delta 3(1) plus, and

307
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,080
then the thing I have in red, that's

308
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,530
theta 2(2)2

309
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,230
times Delta 3(2).

310
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,550
So it is really, literally this red

311
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,340
weight times this value, plus this

312
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,690
magenta weight times it's value

313
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,820
and that's how we wind up with that value of delta.

314
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,490
And just as another example, let's look at this value.

315
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,750
How did we get that value?

316
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,660
Well, it's a similar

317
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,490
process, if this weight,

318
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,000
which I'm going to highlight in

319
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,310
green, if this weight is

320
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,860
equal to, say, delta

321
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,990
3(1)2, then we have

322
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,360
that, delta 3(2) is

323
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,010
going to be equal to

324
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,860
that green weight, theta 3(1)2

325
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,260
times delta 4(1).

326
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,520
And by the

327
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,560
way, so far I've been

328
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,310
writing the delta values only

329
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,390
for the hidden units and

330
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,750
not, but not, excluding the bias units.

331
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,610
Depending on how you define

332
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,170
the back propagation algorithm or depending on

333
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,610
how you implement it, you know,

334
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,510
you may end up implementing something

335
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,390
to compute delta values for

336
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,950
these bias units as well.

337
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,230
The bias unit is always output

338
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,880
the values plus one and they

339
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,980
are just what they are and there's

340
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,060
no way for us to change

341
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,960
the value and so, depending

342
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,440
on your implementation of back prop,

343
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,960
the way I usually implement it,

344
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,180
I do end up computing these

345
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,670
delta values, but we

346
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,900
just discard them and we

347
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,560
don't use them, because they don't

348
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,130
end up being part of

349
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,130
the calculation needed to compute the derivatives.

350
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,720
So, hopefully, that gives

351
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,360
you a little bit of intuition

352
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,380
about what back propagation is doing.

353
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,290
In case of all this, they

354
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,670
still seem so magical and

355
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,090
so black box, in a

356
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,560
later video, in the

357
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,880
putting it together video, I'll try

358
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,650
to give a little more intuition about what that back propagation is doing.

359
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,360
But, unfortunately, this is, you

360
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,370
know, a difficult algorithm to

361
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,770
try to visualize and understand what it is really doing.

362
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,790
But fortunately, you know,

363
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,280
often I guess, many people

364
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,930
have been using it very successfully

365
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,640
for many years and if

366
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,810
you infer the algorithm, you have

367
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,090
a very effective learning algorithm, even

368
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,400
though the inner workings of exactly

369
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,190
how it works can be harder to visualize.
