1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,410
In this video, I'd like to

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,590
talk about the Gaussian distribution, which

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,810
is also called the normal distribution.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,940
In case you're already intimately

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,980
familiar with the Gaussian distribution, it is

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,810
probably okay to skip this video.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,890
But if you're not sure or

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,890
if it's been a while since you've

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,770
worked with a Gaussian distribution or the normal

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,480
distribution then please do

11
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,960
watch this video all the way to the end.

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,260
And in the video after this,

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,740
we'll start applying the Gaussian

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,890
distribution to developing an anomaly detection algorithm.

15
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,310
Let's say x is a

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,470
real value random variable, so x is a real number.

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,080
If the probability distribution of

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,160
x is Gaussian, it

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,710
would mean Mu and variant

20
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,360
sigma squared, then we'll

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,600
write this as x the

22
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,270
random variable tilde.

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,300
That's this little tilde

24
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:59,520
as distributed as and then

25
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,550
to denote the Gaussian Distribution, sometimes

26
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,930
you're going to write script n, parentheses

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,140
Mu, sigma squared.

28
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,310
So, this script's end stands for

29
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,920
normal, since Gaussian and normal

30
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,170
distribution, they mean the same

31
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,660
phase of synonymous and a

32
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,190
Gussian distribution is parameterized

33
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,430
by 2 parameters, by a

34
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,930
mean parameter which we

35
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,770
denote Mu, and a variance

36
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,010
parameter, which we denote by sigma squared.

37
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,270
If we pluck the Gaussian distribution

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,100
or Gaussian probability density, it

39
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,760
will look like the bell shaped

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,820
curve, which you may have seen before.

41
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,860
And so, this bell-shaped curve

42
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,350
is parameterized by those 2 parameters Mu and sigma.

43
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,670
And the location of the

44
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,230
center of this bell-shaped curve

45
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,960
is the mean Mu, and the

46
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,150
width of this bell-shaped curve,

47
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,020
so it's roughly that, is

48
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,970
the, this parameter

49
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,390
sigma, is also called one standard deviation.

50
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,350
And so, this specifies the

51
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,630
probability of x taking

52
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,990
on different values, so x

53
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,730
taking on values, you know

54
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,770
in the middle here is pretty high

55
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,290
since the Gaussian density here

56
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,490
is pretty high whereas

57
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,540
x taking on values further and

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,310
further away will be diminishing

59
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,600
in probability. Finally, just

60
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,770
for completeness, let me write

61
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,260
out the formula for the Gaussian

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,310
distribution so the property

63
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,780
of x and I'll

64
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,940
sometimes write this instead of

65
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,070
p of x, I'm going

66
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,960
to write this as p of

67
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,930
x semicolon Mu comma sigma squared.

68
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,750
And so this denotes that the probability of

69
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,670
x is parametrized by

70
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,660
the two parameters Mu and sigma squared.

71
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,330
And the formula for the

72
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,760
Gaussian density is this,

73
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,860
1 over 2pi, sigma e

74
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,510
to the negative x minus Mu squared over 2 sigma squared.

75
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,980
So there's no need to memorize this

76
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,530
formula, you know, this

77
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,410
is just the formula for the

78
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,020
bell-shaped curve over here on the left.

79
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,100
There's no need to memorize it and

80
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,990
if you ever need to use this,

81
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,460
you can always look this up.

82
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,450
And so that figure on the

83
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,420
left, that is what you get

84
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,100
if you take a fixed

85
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,200
value of Mu and a

86
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,070
fixed value of sigma and

87
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,140
you plot p of x. So this

88
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,830
curve here, this is really

89
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,000
p of x plotted as a

90
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,540
function of x, you know,

91
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,970
for a fixed value of Mu

92
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,770
and of sigma squared sigma squared, that's called the variance.

93
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,270
And sometimes it's easier to think in terms of sigma.

94
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,730
So sigma is called the

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,850
standard deviation and it,

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,640
so it specifies the

97
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,310
width of this Gaussian probability

98
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,120
density whereas the square

99
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,490
of sigma, so sigma squared, is

100
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,830
called the variance. Let's look

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,980
at some examples of what the Gaussian distribution looks like.

102
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,280
If Mu equals zero, sigma equals 1.

103
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,730
Then we have a Gaussian distribution

104
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,000
that is centered around zero, because that's Mu.

105
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,560
And the width of this Gaussian, so

106
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,610
that's one standard deviation is sigma over there.

107
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,330
Let's look at some examples of

108
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,770
Gaussians. If Mu

109
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,750
is equal to zero it equals 1.

110
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,150
Then that corresponds to a

111
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,030
Gaussian distribution that is centered

112
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,380
at zero since Mu is zero.

113
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,310
And the width of this Gaussian

114
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,570
is Gaussian thus controlled

115
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,430
by sigma by that variance parameter sigma.

116
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,390
Here's another example.

117
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,270
Let's say Mu is equal to

118
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,670
zero and sigma is equal to one-half.

119
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,290
So the standard deviation is

120
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,650
one-half and the variance

121
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,550
sigma squared would therefore be

122
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,600
the square of 0.5 would be 0.25.

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,910
And in that case the Gaussian distribution,

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
the Gaussian probability density looks

125
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,490
like this, is also centered at zero.

126
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,410
But now the width of

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,250
this is much smaller because

128
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,170
the smaller variance, the

129
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,980
width of this Gaussian density

130
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,350
is roughly half as wide.

131
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,710
But because this is a

132
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,590
probability distribution, the area under

133
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,850
the curve, that is the shaded

134
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,790
area there, that area

135
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,810
must integrate to 1.

136
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,500
This is a property of probability distributions.

137
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,680
And so, you know, this

138
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,530
is a much taller Gaussian density because

139
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,050
it's half as wide, with

140
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,150
half the standard deviation, but it's twice as tall.

141
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,510
Another example, if sigma is

142
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,540
equal to 2, then you

143
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,870
get a much fatter, or much wider Gaussian density.

144
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,090
And so here, the sigma

145
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,300
parameter controls that this

146
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,000
Gaussian density has a wider width.

147
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,180
And once again, the area under

148
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,390
the curve, that is this shaded

149
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,720
area, you know, it always integrates to 1.

150
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,170
That's a property of probability

151
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,280
distributions, and because it's

152
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,930
wider, it's also half as

153
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,640
tall, in order to just integrate to the same thing.

154
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,520
And finally, one last example would be,

155
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,980
if we now changed the Mu

156
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,660
parameters as well, then instead

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,320
of being centered at zero, we

158
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,840
now we have a Gaussian distribution

159
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,810
that is centered at three, because

160
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,740
this shifts over the entire Gaussian distribution.

161
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,040
Next, lets take about the parameter estimation problem.

162
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,570
So what is the parameter estimation problem?

163
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,350
Let's say we have a data set

164
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,180
of m examples, so x1

165
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,470
through x(m), and let's say

166
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,250
each of these examples is a real number.

167
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,520
Here in the figure, I've plotted an

168
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,390
example of a data set,

169
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,390
so the horizontal axis is the

170
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,430
x axis and, you know, I

171
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,290
have a range of examples of x and I've just plotted them

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,060
on this figure here.

173
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,280
And the parameter estimation problem is, let's

174
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,750
say I suspect that these examples

175
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,160
came from a Gaussian distribution so

176
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,560
let's say I suspect that each of my example x(i) was distributed.

177
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,930
That's what this tilde thing means.

178
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,520
Thus, I suspect that each of

179
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,220
these examples was distributed according

180
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,190
to a normal distribution or

181
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,060
Gaussian distribution with some

182
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,210
parameter Mu and some parameter sigma squared.

183
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,560
But I don't know what the values of these parameters are.

184
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,360
The problem with parameter estimation is,

185
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,480
given my data set I want

186
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,720
to figure out, I want to

187
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,840
estimate, what are the

188
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,470
values of Mu and sigma squared.

189
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,570
So, if you're given a

190
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,660
data set like this, you know,

191
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,050
it looks like maybe, if I

192
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,210
estimate what Gaussian distribution the

193
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,010
data came from, maybe that

194
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,770
might be roughly the Gaussian distribution

195
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,410
it came from, with Mu

196
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,350
being the center of the distribution and

197
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,680
sigma the standard deviation controlling the width of this Gaussian distribution.

198
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,820
It seems like a reasonable

199
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,280
fit to the data, because, you know, it

200
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
looks the data has

201
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,910
a very high probability of being

202
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,590
in the central region, low probability of

203
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,720
being further out, low probability of being further out, and so on.

204
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,770
And so, maybe this is

205
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,360
a reasonable estimate of

206
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,920
Mu and of sigma squared,

207
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,810
that is, if it corresponds to

208
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,970
a Gaussian distribution, that then looks like this.

209
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,340
So, what I'm going to

210
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,550
do is write out the

211
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,090
formulas, the standard formulas

212
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,920
for estimating the parameters from

213
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,480
Mu and sigma squared.

214
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,860
The way we are going to

215
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,140
estimate Mu is going to

216
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,850
be just the average

217
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,630
of my example.

218
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,190
So Mu is the mean parameter,

219
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,340
so I'm going to take my

220
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,350
training set, take my m

221
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,200
examples and average them.

222
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,120
And that just gives me the center of this distribution.

223
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:01,670
How about sigma squared?

224
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,110
Well the variance, I'll just

225
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,890
write out the standard formula again,

226
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,780
I'm going to estimate as sum

227
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,900
of 1 through m of x(i),

228
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,730
minus Mu squared,

229
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,130
and so this Mu here is

230
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,030
actually the Mu that I compute

231
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,580
over here using this formula,

232
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,920
and what the variance is, or

233
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,890
one interpretation of the variance,

234
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,230
is that, if you look at the

235
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,580
this term, that's the square

236
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,580
difference between the value

237
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,190
I've got in my example minus

238
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,300
the mean, minus the center, minus the mean of distribution.

239
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,690
And so, you know, the

240
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,630
variance, I'm gonna estimate

241
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,530
as just the average of

242
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,520
the square differences, between my examples, minus the mean.

243
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,370
And as a side comment,

244
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,150
only for those of you that are experts

245
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,820
in statistics, if you're

246
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,690
an expert in statistics and if

247
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,570
you've heard of maximum likelihood estimation,

248
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,950
then these estimates are actually the

249
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,530
maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters

250
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,590
of Mu and sigma squared.

251
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,260
But if you haven't heard of that before, don't worry about it.

252
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,500
All you need to know is that

253
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,880
these are the two standard formulas

254
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,090
for how you try to

255
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,820
figure out what our Mu and sigma squared given the dataset.

256
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,140
Finally one last side comment.

257
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,810
Again only for those of

258
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,520
you that has maybe taken a statistics class before.

259
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,040
But if you have taken a statistics

260
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,530
class before, some of you

261
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,620
may have seen the formula here

262
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,810
where, you know, this is m minus

263
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,300
1, instead of m. So

264
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,310
this first term becomes 1

265
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,410
over m minus 1, instead

266
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,640
of 1 over m. In machine

267
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,170
learning, people tend to use this 1 over m formula.

268
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,230
But in practice, whether it

269
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,480
is 1 over m or 1

270
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,710
over m minus one, makes essentially

271
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,290
no difference, assuming, you know, m is

272
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,670
reasonably large, it's a large training set size.

273
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,480
So, just in case you've seen

274
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,570
this other version before, in either

275
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,970
version it works just equally

276
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,630
well, but in machine

277
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,850
learning most people tend to

278
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,410
use 1 over m in this formula.

279
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,740
And the two versions have slightly

280
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,770
different theoretical properties, slightly different

281
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,530
mathematical properties, but in

282
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,080
practice it really makes very little difference, if any.

283
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,670
So, hopefully, you now have

284
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,900
a good sense of what the

285
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,410
Gaussian distribution looks like,

286
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,210
as well as how to estimate

287
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,730
the parameters, mu and sigma

288
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,770
squared, of the Gaussian distribution, and

289
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,510
if you're given a training set,

290
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,940
that is if you're given a

291
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,220
set of data that you suspect

292
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,350
comes from a Gaussian

293
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,190
distribution with unknown parameters using sigma squared.

294
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,510
In the next video, we'll start

295
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,820
to take this and apply it

296
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,810
to develop the anomaly detection algorithm.
