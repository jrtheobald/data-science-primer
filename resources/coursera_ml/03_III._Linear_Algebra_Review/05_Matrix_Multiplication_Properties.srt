1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,920
Matrix multiplication is really

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,302
useful since you can pack

3
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:05,494
a lot of computation into just

4
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:08,092
one matrix multiplication operation.

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,829
But you should be careful of how you use them.

6
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:12,103
In this video I want to

7
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:16,974
tell you about a few properties of matrix multiplication.

8
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,678
When working with just raw

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,653
numbers or when working with

10
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:25,797
scalars, multiplication is commutative.

11
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:27,459
And what I mean by that is

12
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:29,272
if you take three times

13
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:30,873
five, that is equal

14
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:32,368
to five times three and

15
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,371
the ordering of this multiplication doesn't matter.

16
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:38,271
And this is called the commutative

17
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,952
property of multiplication of real numbers.

18
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:43,765
It turns out this property that

19
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,299
you can, you know, reverse

20
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,317
the order in which you

21
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:50,217
multiply things, this is not true for matrix multiplication.So

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,294
concretely, if A and

23
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:53,423
B are matrices, then in

24
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,120
general, A times B is

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,653
not equal to B times

26
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:58,220
A.  So just be careful of that.

27
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,530
It's not okay to arbitrarily reverse

28
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,545
the order in which you are multiplying matrices.

29
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,892
So, we say that matrix multiplication

30
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:06,420
is not commutative, it's a fancy

31
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,480
way of saying it.

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,028
As a concrete example, here

33
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:13,156
are two matrices, matrix 1100

34
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,302
times 0020, and if you multiply

35
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:17,018
these two matrices, you get this result on the right.

36
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,428
Now, let's swap around the order of these two matrices.

37
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,857
So, I'm going to take these

38
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:24,244
two matrices and just reverse them.

39
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,511
It turns out if you multiply

40
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,629
these two matrices, you get

41
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,525
the second answer on the

42
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:31,423
right and, you know, real

43
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,652
clearly, these two matrices are

44
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:36,099
not equal to each other.

45
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,159
So, in fact, in

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,120
general, if you have

47
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,585
a matrix operation like

48
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:44,793
A times B. If A

49
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:47,301
is an m by n matrix

50
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:49,188
and B is an by

51
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,415
M matrix, just as an example.

52
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,974
Then, it turns out

53
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,735
that the matrix A times

54
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:59,042
B right, is going

55
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:01,258
to be an m by

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,792
m matrix, where as

57
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,410
the matrix b x a

58
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,390
is going to be an n

59
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,928
by n matrix so the

60
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:11,406
dimensions don't even match, right,

61
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,283
so A times B and

62
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,647
B times A may not even be the same dimension.

63
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:17,762
In the example on the left,

64
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,265
I have all two by two matrices,

65
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,342
so the dimensions were the same,

66
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:22,688
but in general reversing the

67
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:25,285
order of the matrices

68
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,301
can even change the dimension

69
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:30,030
of the outcome so

70
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,291
matrix multiplication is not commutative.

71
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,302
Here's the next I want to talk about.

72
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,663
So, when talking about real

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,731
numbers, or scalars, let's

74
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:42,859
see, I have 3 times 5 times 2.

75
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,848
I can either multiply 5

76
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:47,625
times 2 first, and

77
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,394
I can compute this as 3 times 10.

78
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,936
Or, I can multiply

79
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:54,635
three times five for us and

80
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:55,804
I can compute this as, you

81
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:58,029
know fifteen times two and

82
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:59,885
both of these give you the same answer, right?

83
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:01,007
Each, both of these is equal

84
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,895
to thirty so Whether I

85
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,433
multiply five times

86
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,185
two first or whether I

87
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:09,746
multiply three times five

88
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:12,663
first because well, three

89
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:14,670
times five times two

90
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,389
is equal to three times

91
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:18,894
five times two.

92
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:20,445
And this is called the

93
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:27,022
associative property of role number multiplication.

94
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:30,695
It turns out that matrix multiplication is associative.

95
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,335
So concretely, let's say

96
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:33,452
I have a product of three

97
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:34,762
matrices, A times B times

98
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:36,189
C. Then I can

99
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,818
compute this either as A

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,412
times, B times C

101
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,838
or I can compute this as

102
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:45,310
A times B, times C

103
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,125
and these will actually give me the same answer.

104
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,310
I'm not going to prove this, but

105
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,556
you can just take my word for it, I guess.

106
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:52,692
So just be clear what I mean by

107
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,340
these two cases, let's look

108
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,263
at first one first case.

109
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,345
What I mean by that is

110
00:03:57,345 --> 00:03:58,405
if you actually want to compute

111
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,925
A times B times C, what

112
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,410
you can do is you can

113
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,078
first compute B times C.

114
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,423
So that D equals B time

115
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:05,848
C, then compute A times

116
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:07,178
D.  And so this is really

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,605
computing a times B

118
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:12,406
times C.  Or, for

119
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,895
this second case, You can

120
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:16,065
compute this as, you can

121
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,673
set E equals A

122
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,142
times B.  Then compute E

123
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:20,750
times C.  And this

124
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,912
is then the same as a

125
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,526
times B times C

126
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,322
and it turns out that both

127
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:30,115
of these options will give

128
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:33,702
you, is guaranteed to give you the same answer.

129
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:35,115
And so we say that matrix

130
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:39,692
multiplication does enjoy the associative property.

131
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:40,592
Okay?

132
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,752
And don't worry about the terminology

133
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:44,609
associative and commutative that's

134
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,083
why there's not really going to use

135
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,586
this terminology later in these

136
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:50,608
class, so don't worry about memorizing those terms.

137
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:52,841
Finally, I want to

138
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:54,552
tell you about the identity

139
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:56,676
matrix, which is special matrix.

140
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,202
So let's again make the

141
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,296
analogy to what we know

142
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:01,342
of raw numbers, so when dealing

143
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,842
with raw numbers or scalar

144
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:04,562
numbers, the number one,

145
00:05:04,562 --> 00:05:06,131
is you can think

146
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:09,756
of it as the identity of multiplication,

147
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,853
and what I mean by that

148
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,885
is for any number

149
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:14,942
Z, the number 1

150
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,803
times z is equal

151
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,754
to z times one, and

152
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,550
that's just equal to

153
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,548
the number z, right, for any raw number.

154
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:26,128
Z. So 1 is

155
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:29,891
the identity operation and so it satisfies this equation.

156
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,755
So it turns out that

157
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,297
in the space of matrices as

158
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:35,453
an identity matrix as well.

159
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:38,375
And it's unusually denoted i,

160
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,573
or sometimes we write it

161
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:40,945
as i of n by

162
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,079
n we want to make explicit the dimensions.

163
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,355
So I subscript n by n

164
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:47,391
is the n by n identity matrix.

165
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,339
And so there's a different identity

166
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:53,375
matrix for each dimension n and are a few examples.

167
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,912
Here's the two by two identity

168
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:56,447
matrix, here's the three

169
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:59,882
by three identity matrix, here's the four by four identity matrix.

170
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:01,858
So the identity matrix, has the

171
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:03,602
property that it has

172
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:06,348
ones along the diagonals,

173
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,325
right, and so on and

174
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,915
is zero everywhere else, and

175
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,012
so, by the way the

176
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:17,425
one by one identity matrix is just a number one.

177
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:18,740
This is one by one matrix

178
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,090
just and it's not a very

179
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,242
interesting identity matrix and informally

180
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,593
when I or others are being

181
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,438
sloppy, very often, we will

182
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:28,878
write the identity matrix using fine notation.

183
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,574
I draw, you know, let's

184
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:31,675
go back to it and just write 1111,

185
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,565
dot, dot, dot, 1

186
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:34,928
and then we'll, maybe, somewhat

187
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,650
sloppily write a bunch of zeros there.

188
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,750
And these zeros, this

189
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,474
big zero, this big zero

190
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:44,262
that's meant to denote that this

191
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:46,174
matrix is zero everywhere except for

192
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:47,367
the diagonals, so this is just

193
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,680
how I might sloppily write

194
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,251
this identity matrix

195
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,138
She says property that for

196
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,493
any matrix A, A times

197
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:59,635
identity i times A

198
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,892
A. So that's a lot

199
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:04,782
like this equation that we have up here.

200
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:06,502
One times z equals z times

201
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:08,427
one, equals z itself so

202
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,972
I times A equals A

203
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,566
times I equals A.  Just

204
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,095
make sure we have the dimensions right, so

205
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:15,721
if A is a n

206
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:18,065
by n matrix, then this

207
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,952
identity matrix that's an

208
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:22,797
m by n identity matrix.

209
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,573
And if A is m by

210
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,595
n then this identity

211
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:28,766
matrix, right, for matrix

212
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,270
multiplication make sense that has a

213
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,008
m by n matrix because

214
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:34,305
this m has a match

215
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,948
up that m And

216
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:38,619
in either case the outcome

217
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:40,042
of this process is you

218
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,025
get back to Matrix A, which

219
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,501
is m by n.

220
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,068
So whenever we write

221
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,728
the identity matrix I, you

222
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,798
know, very often the dimension rightwill

223
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,473
be implicit from the context.

224
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,665
So these two I's they' re

225
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:55,645
actually different dimension matrices, one

226
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:56,789
may be N by N, the other

227
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:58,985
is M by M But when

228
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:00,505
we want to make the dimension

229
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,831
of the matrix explicit, then sometimes

230
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,468
we'll write to this I subscript

231
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,470
N by N, kind of like we have up here.

232
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,854
But very often the dimension will be implicit.

233
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,513
Finally, just want to point

234
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:14,606
out that earlier I

235
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:16,458
said that A times B

236
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,069
is not in general equal

237
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,595
to B times A, right?

238
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:25,687
That for most matrices A and B, this is not true.

239
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,558
But when B is the identity matrix, this does hold true.

240
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,840
That A times the identity

241
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,390
matrix does indeed equal to

242
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,523
identity times A, it's

243
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:35,858
just that this is not true

244
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:39,124
for other matrices, B in general.

245
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,645
So that's it for the

246
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,994
properties of matrix multiplication.

247
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:45,416
And the special matrices, like the

248
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,618
identity matrix I want to

249
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,505
tell you about, in the next

250
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:51,690
and final video now linear algebra review.

251
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,337
I am going to quickly tell you

252
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,895
about a couple of special

253
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:58,190
matrix operations, and after

254
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,328
that you know everything you need

255
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,830
to know about linear algebra for this course
